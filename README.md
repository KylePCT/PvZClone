# Plants vs. Zombies Unity Clone
 
Going to keep this repository public so I can show progress and others are welcome to also learn from it. :)
 
Plants vs. Zombies (2009) is a tower-defence game where you use different types of plants to attack the zombies trying to eat your brains. In 2009, I was a teenager slowly becoming inspired by game design with PvZ becoming one of the games I spent a lot of time on. With its simple gameplay loop, fun gameplay and challenge; Iâ€™ve decided it would be a fun game to try and create within the Unity game engine.
